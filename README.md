# Banking Application

This is a single page Banking Application made with Create React App. This is the final project from the React portion of my course.

# Usage

The account information for this application is saved locally in an array and if the page is refreshed all data will be lost.

In this application you can:
<li>Create an Account
<li>Login to an account
<li>Deposit funds into account
<li>withdraw funds from account
